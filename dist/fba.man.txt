How to use FB Alpha
----

FBA SDL is now merged with the frontend based on Capex in one application. Just
run it, press START and choose Rom Show mode: all, available or non-available.
If needed, supplementary rom paths could be set.

FBA SDL could be used as a standalone application when invoked with
rom zip with full path as a parameter:

./fba /mnt/roms/FBA/dino.zip

Full path and extension are obligatory.
